# MHFZ-Taiwan-Site

WIP Translation of MHFZ TW Site. Will then find a way to retrieve the source code for the pre-closure MHFZZ site on [the archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20191218005522/http://www.mhf-z.jp/index.html)
IF someone manages to get the original JP source code directly from some browser's devtools or something else I will help translating that

# What has been translated yet?

Nothing.
I'm trying to download all the images first, which is simple, but time consuming (I can only download them from my browser's devtools one by one).
